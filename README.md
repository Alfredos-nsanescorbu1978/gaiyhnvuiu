OMG, just finished Ad Vitam and like, wow, you ever feel like your brain’s been baked and then flipped upside down? Seriously, it's like, immortality but make it sad and complicated. I swear I spent half the time trying to figure out what was even happening. You know what I mean? The visuals tho, absolutely insane. Like, imagine 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 the   and just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 all those crazy scenes again. Mind blown every time!

And can we talk about how those dudes are just forever young? Like, isn’t that what everyone dreams of? But then the whole will you ever be truly alive if you can’t die thing hits. Heavy stuff. I kept thinking, would I wanna live forever like that? Not so sure, tbh. I mean, pizza forever? Yes. But dealing with endless drama? Nah, pass!

> Then there's that dude, Darius. You get to this point where you're just like, Dude, are you okay? Like, seriously? One minute he's chill, the next he's deep into some mystery like it’s a detective noir. I couldn't decide if I wanna be him or just give him a giant hug. The whole vibe's so moody but in a ‘can’t-look-away’ kinda way, you feel me?

The soundtrack tho! Totally gonna 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 it when I get the chance. Fits the vibe perfectly—chill but kinda eerie, jumps right into your head. Makes me wanna do something creative or just contemplate life, y’know? Like, makes me wanna just sit there and soak in the entire weirdness of it all. 

And ah, the ending! I don’t even know if I got it, but kind of love it for that. Leaves you hanging, wanting more, but also like none of these answers would satisfy anyway. That’s some next-level stuff I didn’t sign up for. Typical French cinema, I guess? Or sci-fi? Whatever, pigeons. 

if(youth == forever) { console.WriteLine(Mind boggled); }

Anyway, long story short, kinda tired but can’t stop thinking about it. A part of me wants to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again, just to pick up on things I missed, but also pretending I know enough about philosophy at 1 a.m. and feeling funky about it, haha. Sigh adulthood, right?
